## Step 4: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you get authentication errors:
1. Set up a Personal Access Token on GitHub
2. Use it as your password when prompted
3. Or configure SSH keys for easier access

### If the branch is called 'master' instead of 'main':
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

### To check current status:
```bash
git status
```

### To see what files will be committed:
```bash
git diff --cached --name-status
```
